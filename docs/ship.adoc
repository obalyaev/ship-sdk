[abstract]
The Simple Hospitality Interchange Protocol, or SHIP, is a JSON-based message format, combined with a simple HTTP-based API, that aims to make it easy for hospitality-related systems and applications to exchange messages. This document contains specifications of the JSON messages, as well as a number of sample messages. For details on the HTTP-based API, please contact your SHIP integration partner.
